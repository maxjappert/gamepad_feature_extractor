This feature extractor works for the Logitech ATK3 joystick. It extracts the X and Y positions of the main joystick, as well as the "throttle" lever, which is denoted as the Z axis. As such the joystick can be used to play an instrument controlled by OSC messages. The interplay between the three axes allows for quite a degree of dynamic control of the output.

It is implemented using Processing, as such only the Processing IDE is required to run it. The program simply needs to be started and then used as the other example input programs are used.
